# Uhome (U-Tec) Home Assistant Integration

A Home Assistant integration for U-Tec smart home devices via the Uhome API that allows you to control your locks, lights, switches, and sensors through Home Assistant.

## Device Types
- Supports multiple U-tec device types:
    - Locks
    - Lights
    - Switches
    - Smart Plugs (Wifi)
 
### Features
- Secure API communication
- Locking and unlocking
- Lock states
- Door states
- Battery levels
- Switch on and off (Lightbulbs use the switch capabilitiy for some reason, so at very least they should have rudimentary functionality)
- SwitchLevel (Honestly, idk what this is actually for, but hopefully we can use it to control light brightness until they properly implement light controls)

## Limitations
- Currently the Utec API doesn't support the following devices:
	- Wifi bridge modules
	- Air Portal registration / devices

## Requirements
- API Credentials
- External Access Configured (ie., Nabu Casa)

## Getting Your Credentials
#### Having your credentials is nessecary to configure the integration, so get them before you install it.

API credentials are now available directly in the Xthings Home app (formerly U-Home) version 3.5.5 or later. No need to submit a request through the developer portal.

1. Open the Xthings Home app and go to **My Account**
2. Tap **OpenAPI**
3. Follow the prompts to activate OpenAPI — select your role and the products you are integrating with, then tap **Activate Openapi**

Once activated, you will see your `Client ID`, `Client Secret`, `Scope`, and `RedirectUri`.
- Set `RedirectUri` to `https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/oauth`
- Confirm `Scope` is set to `OpenAPI`
- Tap **Save**

For the integration you will need `Client ID` and `Client Secret`.

For more information, see the [Developer API Documentation](https://doc.api.u-tec.com/#intro). If you run into issues with the API, you can [submit a support request](https://developer.xthings.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).
